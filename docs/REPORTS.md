# Interpreting reports #

The View Reports button on each variant editing page takes you to a page
with graphs of key metrics for that variant set.
Use this page to evaluate your variants' performances against each other
and to check that your integrations are correctly configured.

### Percent of shares that lead to conversions or clicks ###

Conversions are actions defined by your integration.
Clicks are any clicks on the generated links.
Both rates are calculated as a/b, 
where a = total number of conversions or clicks of the variant as of the timestamp, 
and b = total number of shares of the variant as of the timestamp.
If you want a conversion to correspond to a signing a petition after 
clicking through the shared link, you'll need to configure your integration
so that the action event fires after the signature is complete.
Conversion figures should be lower than clickthrough figures.

### Variant selection rates for conversions and clicks ###

Each time a sharebandit post is shared, a variant is selected for display
either randomly (in the first 20 * number of variants cycles) or via the
bandit algorithm. The data points on the graph represent the cumulative 
selection rate for each variant at each selection timestamp, x/n, where 
x = selections of this variant up to this timestamp and 
n = total selections of variants in this group up this timestamp.
Two separate graphs show variant selection rates based on conversion rates
or on click rates.
Relative variant selection rates should roughly correspond to their relative
conversion or click rates.

### Total converted shares by variant ###

A cumulative area graph of the raw number of converted shares generated by each
variant.

### (Button) Simulate selection rates for conversions ###

Using conversion rate data, simulates bandit algorithm selection 100 times at 
each timestamp and plots the results. Clicking on this button reloads all of the
graphs on the page in addition to running the simulation and graphing the results.
